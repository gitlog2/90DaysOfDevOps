Networking Administration
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and information together. 
This basic of computer networking, including network types, components, protocols, and essential services like the Domain Name System (DNS).

Q:1. How Does a Computer Network Work?
Ans. Computer networking devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.
Basic Terminologies of Computer Networks: 
•	Network: It is a collection of computers and devices that are connected together to enable communication for data exchange.
•	Nodes: These are devices that are connected to a network. These can include computers, Servers, Printers, Routers, Switches, and other devices.
•	Protocol: It is a set of rules and standards that manage how data is transmitted over a network. Like. tcp/ip, https and ftp.
•	Topology: It is physical and logical arrangement of nodes on a network. The common network topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree.
•	Service Provider Networks: These types of Networks give permission to take Network Capacity and Functionality on lease from the Provider. Service Provider Networks include Wireless Communications, Data Carriers, etc.
•	IP Address: It is a unique numerical identifier that is assigned to every device on a network. That is used to identify devices and enable communication between them.
•	DNS: Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that is used to translate human-readable domain names (such as www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.
•	Firewall: It is a security device that is used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls are used to protect networks from unauthorized access and other security threats.

Types of Enterprise Computer Networks:
•	LAN: Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that covers a small area, such as an office or a home. LANs are typically used to connect computers and other devices within a building or a campus.
•	WAN: A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that covers a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or even the entire world. WANs are used to connect LANs together and are typically used for long-distance communication.
•	Cloud Networks: Cloud Networks can be visualized with a Wide Area Network (WAN) as they can be hosted on public or private cloud service providers and cloud networks are available if there is a demand. Cloud Networks consist of Virtual Routers, Firewalls, etc.

Types of Computer Network Architecture:
•	Client-Server Architecture: Client-Server Architecture is a type of Computer Network Architecture in which Nodes can be Servers or Clients. Here, the server node can manage the Client Node Behaviour.
•	Peer-to-Peer Architecture: In P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Architecture, there is not any concept of a Central Server. Each device is free for working as either client or server.
